-> In some places, a path to the output location for plots needs to be specified. The plots will be saved at those locations 
-> To implement code in section 7, the brazilian cities dataset is required (the exact location is commented in the code) (line 669)
-> The dataset is added to the zip folder and is also uploaded to this drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jZX9k-o4lNetEXvQr-wnQeAEX3RheZsW
